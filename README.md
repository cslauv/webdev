Hey guys,
  The files that branch out from the master will follow the naming convention change_nameOfTheChange so that we
  know what changes are made for that specific file. Once it is confirm and there's no errors in the code, the changes will be finalized
  to the master webpage.
  
  Also, please send out a message to slack to notify that there's a change waiting for approval.
  
  Let's finish this guys :)
